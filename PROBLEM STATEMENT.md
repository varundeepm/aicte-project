**PROBLEM STATEMENT** 



Rapid urbanization in cities like Coimbatore has led to deteriorating road conditions, frequent collisions, and environmental degradation.

Existing manual monitoring systems are inefficient and costly.

Therefore, there is a need for a sustainable, continuous, and automated CNN-based system that can detect road hazards, blocked paths, new constructions, and environmental changes in real time using crowdsourced smartphone imagery — ensuring safer, greener, and smarter urban infrastructure.
